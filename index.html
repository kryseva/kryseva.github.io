	<p><h2>Introduction</h2></p>
	<p><h4>My name is Krystal Evans and I'm a fourth year majoring in Psychology and minoring in communications studies and women's studies. 
		I was born in Madison, Wisconsin but I moved to Georgia at the age of eight. I am 21 years old. I attended three high schools but I 
		graduated from Carlton J Kell High School in Marietta, Georgia. I am proud to be the <i>first</i> member of my family to attend college and 
		I intend to graduate in the spring of 2018. My goal is to become an attorney and work in both corporate law and human rights law. This 
		is because I believe that everyone should be treated equally regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, or anything that others may see 
		as different. I want to make the world a more welcoming place for all!</h4></p>

	<p><h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2></p>
	<p><h4>I enjoying writing and playing the left handed guitar. I also spend a lot of time reading and doing arts and crafts. While I'm not
			the most skilled artists, I enjoy making small things for family members and loved ones. One form of art that I am skilled at is 
			pottery. Fun fact: my mom has pots around the house that I've made and she likes to hold trinkets in them. I have never left the
			country, but I intend to travel the world extensively as well as see all fifty states! Since I'm from Wisconsin, I love the snow
			and cold weather. However, I also enjoy the autumn months. Spring is defintely my <i>least</i> favorite season because of allergies! </h4><p>

	<p><h2>Campus Involvement</h2><p>
	<p><h4>Since I arrived on campus in 2013, I have been involved in a wide range of activities. I have noticed that my passion lies in
		   community service and mentoring, and I have been involved in those things my entire college career. My two favorite organizations
		   thus far have been Alpha Phi Omega and Black Educational Support Team. Alpha Phi Omega is a national co-ed community service fraternity.
		   Black Educational Support Team is a mentoring program for minority freshmen to have a familiar face and resource when they step foot on 
		   campus. I am also an intern in the Solicitor General's office at Athens-Clarke County Courthouse where I work in the victim advocacy section.
